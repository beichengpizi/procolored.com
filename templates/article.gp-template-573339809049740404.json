        "ggZ-cvvgIks_text": "<p>What you see on screen isn’t always what prints out ---unless you calibrate. Calibration tools tweak brightness, contrast, and RGB balance so the screen mimics real paper results. If you want dependable prints, this tiny step is huge.</p>",
        "gg7UDcKFVTf_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3.Use High-Resolution Files (300 DPI or Higher)</strong></span>",
        "gghGUvIwn-__text": "<p>Blurry prints? Not at all.</p><p>To make sure every line and detail comes out sharp and clear, keep files at 300 DPI or more, especially for anything bigger than a standard photo size. Low-res photos may sparkle on the screen but crumble under ink.</p>",
        "ggse5_r46T-_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4.Run a Test Strip First</strong></span>",
        "ggMRoo00ju4_text": "<p>Before sending the whole file to the DTF printer, print a small test strip. This lets you check color, contrast, and sharpness while wasting expensive paper or ink. Spotting issues early lets you tweak settings and save time-and money-on a big run.</p>",
        "ggojNuuEC8B_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. Store Prints the Right Way</strong></span>",
        "ggzYrW6isnf_text": "<p>Even the most stunning print won’t last if you stored it carelessly. Always keep your <a href=\"https://www.procolored.com/collections/dtg-printer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>DTF transfer prints</u></a> into acid-free sleeves or folders, and keep them out of sun, damp air, or wild heat. For gallery display, frame it behind UV glass or in cases built for long-term art.</p>",
        "ggfoEktgTQ6_text": "<span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></span>",
        "ggrxQe6SgcQ_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>1. What’s The Difference Between Giclée And Inkjet?</strong></span>",
        "gg_BdLAHAO9_text": "<p>Great question! Technically Giclée printing is inkjet printing, yet not every inkjet print earns the giclée badge.</p><p>For a piece to be considered that giclee, a few boxes have to be checked:</p><p> </p><p>● High resolution, usually 300 DPI or better.</p><p>● Pigment-based inks, not dye.</p><p>● Archival paper that stands the test of time.</p><p>● Color proofs managed through accurate ICC profiles.</p><p> </p><p>So, think of giclée as the premium version of inkjet printing —ideal for gallery and collector grade-work.</p>",
        "ggGmf_0VEN__text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>2. Can I Use Third-Party Inks For Fine Art?</strong></span>",
        "ggaswBUMG8F_text": "<p>Despite seeming attractive from a price saving perspective, third-party inks tend to skimp-out on consistency over time, coverage spectrum, and ICC profile support. If you’re printing professionally or provided with best archival storage options, sticking to the manufacturer inks is still the safest road.</p>",
        "ggAJW4vVVmr_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>3. Is Pigment Ink Waterproof?</strong></span>",
        "gglYzZ3GqF5_text": "<p>Yes, once they dry on the right paper, pigment inks resist water quite a bit. This toughness is why many artists choose them for fine-art prints. While they aren't truly waterproof in all conditions (like soaking) but they hold up well against humidity and light smudges.</p>",
        "ggM3Ai0iNqH_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>4. Is A Rip (Raster Image Processor) Really Necessary?</strong></span>",
        "ggEKFrk2yZ8_text": "<p>Unless you’re managing complex, high-volume print jobs or craving super-fine color control, most artists and photography don’t need a RIP. Files from Photoshop or Lightroom printed through their ICC profile pipeline work great without a dedicated box.</p><p>A RIP shines in busy print shops, quirky file workflows, or big-format runs where speed and precision rule.</p>",
        "ggYZaaTgStL_text": "<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>5. How Big A Printer Do I Need For Gallery Work?</strong></span>",
        "ggn45Sr1XJt_text": "<p>It comes down to how big a showcase you’ll be doing.</p><p> </p><p>● A 13-inch or 17-inch <a href=\"https://www.procolored.com/collections/dtg-printer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>DTF printer</u></a> will work for small and mid-sized pieces of work.</p><p>● If your printing needs are larger, we recommend 24-inch to 44-inch roll printers.</p><p>Larger artwork printers offer more creative freedom, but also come with extra costs in terms of maintenance and storage space. Select a printer that meets the requirements of both your art and surroundings.</p>",
