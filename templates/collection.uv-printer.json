The special UV inks that printed on the surfaces will dry almost instantly when exposed to the UV light. The printer can print on non-absorbent surfaces and produce high-quality and durable prints. The image printed is vibrant, high-resolution and fade-resistant. Procolored provides UV printers in various sizes and configurations, ranging from A5 suitable for phone case printing to large A3 plus industrial- scale printers used for mass production.</p><p>For printings on hard substrates, we also recommend<a href=\"https://www.procolored.com/collections/uv-dtf-printer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Procolored UV DTF Printer\"> UV DTF printer</a>.</p><p>In addition to UV printing, Procolored also provides DTF printing solutions for different needs.
