Ever since then, manufacturing has remained the dominant production method of commodity industry due to its considerable output and centralized automation.<br>As consumers, manufacturing products benefit us a lot - in shopping malls, supermarkets or even online stores, manufacturing products are easy to fetch and are always at affordable prices with a never-run-out stock; even when they were sold out, consumers can easily find another substitute.<br>But if we intend to start our own business and now style ourselves as sellers, manufacturing industry can be such a nightmare - Can you afford the large stock on hand? Where to store them? What if they have low sales ? What to do if your competitor sells the exact same product $10 lower?<br>Then innovation occurs where there’s a need - now we got print on demand.</p>",

With rapid development and upgradation of printer technology (especially in the areas like compatible inks and built-in curing devices), digital printing has accordingly broaden its applicable printing substrates.<br>Take garment printing as example. Screen printing, as one traditional textile printing method, is recommended to be applied on fabrics like cotton, polyester and so forth, but better avoid delicate ones like silk. DTF printing instead, can be used on a wider range of fabrics including cotton, polyester, blends, nylon, spandex and even silk or other fine fabrics.</p>",
