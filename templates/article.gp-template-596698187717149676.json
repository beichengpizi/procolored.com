        "gg1-9EQT_nC_text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.procolored.com/collections/dtg-printer\"><u>DTG printing</u></a> is a game changer. It works more like a digital art studio than an old-school print shop. Designers aren’t boxed in—they can just go for it. With DTG printing machines, you get:</p><p>●Photorealistic images that nail skin tones, shadows, and depth<br>●Smooth gradients and soft color transitions<br>●Artwork bursting with color, with basically no limits<br>●Freedom to test out small batches without paying for extra setup</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since you don’t have to mess with screens, emulsions, or lining up colors, you can turn out five different versions of a design without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you love details, wild colors, and pushing boundaries, DTG printing puts you fully in charge.</p>",
        "gg1fbP95Mt1_text": "<p>At the end of the day, there’s no “better” or “worse” method. It’s really about what fits the kind of business you want to run. DTG printing and screen printing work best in different situations, and the smart move is to pick with purpose, not just go with the flow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If your brand is all about creativity, personalization, and quick turnarounds, DTG printers give you the freedom to experiment and expand. But if you rely on volume, consistency, and big repeat orders, screen printing is the workhorse that’ll help you grow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So focus on what really matters:</p><p>●Who are you trying to reach?<br>●What do your customers care about?<br>●Where do you want to take your business?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re clear on those things, the right method stands out. Pick the one that fits your goals now and leaves space for you to grow later.</p>",
        "gg2TY8ifpgk_text": "<p>Then you’ve got the screen-print crowd. They care about craft, consistency, and cranking out big orders with precision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Screen printers think in bulk—big runs, big orders, repeatable systems. Their shops are filled with people who geek out over mesh counts, ink chemistry, curing temps, and getting every print just right, even when they’re making thousands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The screen printing press is the engine of their workflow, built to handle massive jobs with colors that last and prints that look sharp, wash after wash. For these businesses, it’s not about chasing the latest trend—<strong>it’s about reliable output, steady growth, and keeping margins tight.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Screen printers shine in places where you need the same thing, over and over: uniforms, team jerseys, event swag, big brand orders. They depend on steady demand and high-volume runs to get the most out of every print.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This mindset is all about structure, process, and serious production power.</p>",

If you understand these mindsets, it gets a lot easier to figure out which one fits your brand’s future.</p>",
        "gg5CGnn1DIG_text": "<p>DTG printing really shines when it comes to custom orders. Since there’s almost no setup, you can charge a premium for even tiny jobs.</p><p>Why do creatives, online shops, and niche brands love DTG printers? Simple:</p><p>●You can sell custom stuff—like personalized tees or pet portraits—for two to five times what it costs you to make them.<br>●There’s no minimum order. Every single shirt makes you money.<br>●People will pay more when you offer a quick turnaround. That speed and convenience? It fattens your margins.<br>●You waste less. No ruined screens, no headaches over misaligned prints. Less waste means more profit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This approach fits perfectly for Etsy sellers, influencers, small fashion lines, or anyone running print-on-demand.
